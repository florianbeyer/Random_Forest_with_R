# Random_Forest_with_R
Random Forest classification of remote sensing data with R

## Getting Started
You should run the script line by line.
So, you have the possibility to adapt the script to your demands.

Don't hesitate to contact me...

## Difference to the python script
In contrast to my python script the R-script gives you a lot of different possibilities to assess your RF model.
The possibilities in R are much more comfortable!
